## ✅ Problems with Provisioning Infra Manually

* For example, we have a simple 3-tier application need to host our application, it requires infrastructure like network, servers, database, volumes, etc.

* To provision infra manually, it is time-consuming and more error-prone. Small misconfigurations can lead to a bunch of errors.

* Managing multiple environments (like dev, staging, prod) manually is hard and error-prone, especially when each one needs different configurations or capacities.

* Manually created infrastructure is not flexible or scalable — it’s difficult to quickly adjust size or resources based on demand.

* Not easy to do cost analysis. Manual creation leads to high costs because all resources may keep running until the infra setup is complete.

* You have to manually track and manage all resources, which becomes difficult as the infrastructure grows.

* There's no proper audit trail — you can’t see who made changes, when, or what was changed.

---

## 🧾 IaC (Infrastructure as Code)

* Instead of doing everything manually, why not define our infrastructure as code?

* One big benefit is we can store the code in a Version Control System (VCS) like Git.

* It becomes easy to create the same infrastructure across multiple environments (dev, test, prod).

* We get clear audit history — who made changes, what changed, and when.

* It is faster and safer to provision, update, or destroy infrastructure using code.

---

## 🔧 Terraform

* Terraform is one of the popular IaC tools that uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) to define cloud resources.

* It’s cloud-agnostic — meaning it can create infrastructure across multiple cloud providers, not just one.

* Terraform maintains a state file to keep track of the resources it manages.

* It supports modules, which help make your code reusable and cleaner by passing different values for different use cases.

### 🔁 **Interpolation in Terraform**

**Interpolation** is a way to insert the value of a variable, resource, or expression into a string using `${...}`.

It's like saying:
➡️ “Put this value here inside the string.”

---

### ✅ **Example**

```hcl
variable "env" {
  default = "dev"
}

output "bucket_name" {
  value = "my-app-${var.env}-bucket"
}
```

#### 💬 Explanation:

* `var.env` is `"dev"`.
* `output` will show:
  `"my-app-dev-bucket"`

---

### 📝 Note:

In **newer versions of Terraform**, you can also use simple string formatting:

```hcl
value = "my-app-${var.env}-bucket"     # interpolation syntax
value = "my-app-${var.env}-bucket"     # still works
value = "my-app-${var.env}-bucket"     # all same result
```

You don’t always need `${}` if it’s just a variable:

```hcl
value = "my-app-${var.env}"   # ✅
value = "my-app-${"dev"}"     # ✅
value = "my-app-" + var.env   # ✅ also allowed
```
Sure! Here's a **simple explanation of variable types in Terraform** with easy examples — perfect for quick learning and revision.

---

## 📦 Variable Types in Terraform

---

### 1. **string**

Used for plain text.

```hcl
variable "env" {
  type    = string
  default = "dev"
}
```

✅ Example use:
`var.env` → `"dev"`

---

### 2. **number**

Used for numeric values (integers or floats).

```hcl
variable "instance_count" {
  type    = number
  default = 3
}
```

✅ Example use:
`var.instance_count` → `3`

---

### 3. **bool**

Used for true/false values.

```hcl
variable "enable_logging" {
  type    = bool
  default = true
}
```

✅ Example use:
`var.enable_logging` → `true`

---

### 4. **list**

A list of values (same type).

```hcl
variable "azs" {
  type    = list(string)
  default = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
}
```

✅ Example use:
`var.azs[0]` → `"us-east-1a"`

---

### 5. **map**

Key-value pairs (like a dictionary).

```hcl
variable "instance_types" {
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    dev  = "t2.micro"
    prod = "t3.large"
  }
}
```

✅ Example use:
`var.instance_types["dev"]` → `"t2.micro"`

---

### 6. **object**

Structured data with named attributes and types.

```hcl
variable "db_config" {
  type = object({
    name     = string
    port     = number
    enabled  = bool
  })
  default = {
    name    = "mydb"
    port    = 5432
    enabled = true
  }
}
```

✅ Example use:
`var.db_config.name` → `"mydb"`

---

### 7. **tuple**

A list with fixed types and positions.

```hcl
variable "sample_tuple" {
  type = tuple([string, number, bool])
  default = ["abc", 123, true]
}
```

✅ Example use:
`var.sample_tuple[1]` → `123`

---

### 🔄 Dynamic types (any)

You can also use `type = any` to allow any type of value.

```hcl
variable "flexible_input" {
  type    = any
  default = "hello"
}
```

## ⚖️ **Terraform Variable Precedence (High → Low)**

| Priority | Source                                 | Example                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1️⃣      | **Command-line `-var` or `-var-file`** | `terraform apply -var="env=prod"`    |
| 2️⃣      | **Environment variables** (`TF_VAR_`)  | `export TF_VAR_env=prod`             |
| 3️⃣      | **Terraform `.tfvars` files**          | `terraform.tfvars`, `prod.tfvars`    |
| 4️⃣      | **Default value in `.tf` file**        | `variable "env" { default = "dev" }` |

---

### 🔍 Let’s go through each one with examples

---

### 1️⃣ **Command Line Variable**

Highest priority — overrides all.

```bash
terraform apply -var="env=prod"
```

✅ Terraform will use `env = "prod"` even if it’s set elsewhere.

---

### 2️⃣ **Environment Variable**

```bash
export TF_VAR_env="staging"
```

✅ Used if no `-var` provided.

---

### 3️⃣ **`.tfvars` File**

Create a file called `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
env = "test"
```

✅ Auto-loaded by Terraform.

You can also use custom files:

```bash
terraform apply -var-file="prod.tfvars"
```

---

### 4️⃣ **Default Value**

In your Terraform code:

```hcl
variable "env" {
  default = "dev"
}
```

✅ Used only if no other value is given.

---

### 🧠 Example: What Happens?

```hcl
variable "env" {
  default = "dev"
}
```

* You have `terraform.tfvars` → `env = "test"`
* You set `export TF_VAR_env="staging"`
* You run:
  `terraform apply -var="env=prod"`

🔚 **Terraform will use:** `env = "prod"` (because command line overrides all)
