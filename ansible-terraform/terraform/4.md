## 🔐 **Security Measures in Terraform**

---

### 1️⃣ **Never commit sensitive data**

* ❌ Don’t hardcode passwords, keys, tokens, etc. in `.tf` files.
* ✅ Use **variables**, **environment variables**, or **secrets manager** instead.

```hcl
variable "db_password" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}
```

---

### 2️⃣ **Use `.gitignore`**

* Always ignore these files to avoid pushing sensitive info:

  ```
  .terraform/
  terraform.tfstate
  terraform.tfvars
  ```

---

### 3️⃣ **Secure your state file**

* The `terraform.tfstate` file contains **real values**, including secrets (IP, keys, passwords).
* ✅ Store it in a **remote backend** like **S3**, and enable:

  * **Encryption**
  * **Versioning**
  * **Access control**

---

### 4️⃣ **Use DynamoDB for state locking**

* Prevents **two people** from running Terraform at the same time.
* Helps avoid **state corruption**.

---

### 5️⃣ **Use IAM roles and least privilege**

* Only give Terraform the **minimum permissions** it needs.
* Avoid using overly broad or admin-level credentials.

---

### 6️⃣ **Enable `prevent_destroy` on critical resources**

* Protect important resources (like databases or S3 buckets) from being deleted accidentally.

```hcl
lifecycle {
  prevent_destroy = true
}
```

---

### 7️⃣ **Limit who can run Terraform**

* Use CI/CD tools or service accounts to manage infrastructure, not personal laptops.
* ✅ Helps enforce **auditing**, **logging**, and **access control**.

---

### 8️⃣ **Review Terraform plans before applying**

* Always run `terraform plan` and check the output before `terraform apply`.
* Helps catch mistakes before they happen.

---

### 9️⃣ **Use Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise**

* They offer:

  * Secure remote execution
  * Policy enforcement (with Sentinel)
  * Audit logging
  * Team management

## ♻️ **Terraform `taint`, `untaint`, and `-replace`**

These commands help you **force Terraform to recreate a resource**, even if there are no changes in your code.

---

### 🔥 `terraform taint`

Marks a resource as **tainted**, so Terraform will **destroy and recreate it** on the next `terraform apply`.

📘 **Syntax:**

```bash
terraform taint <resource_type.resource_name>
```

✅ **Example:**

```bash
terraform taint aws_instance.web
```

---

### 🧹 `terraform untaint`

Removes the **tainted mark**, so the resource will **not be recreated** on apply.

📘 **Syntax:**

```bash
terraform untaint <resource_type.resource_name>
```

✅ **Example:**

```bash
terraform untaint aws_instance.web
```

---

### 🛠️ `terraform apply -replace=...` (✅ Preferred)

This is a **newer and cleaner way** to replace a resource **in a single step**.

📘 **Syntax:**

```bash
terraform apply -replace=<resource_type.resource_name>
```

✅ **Example:**

```bash
terraform apply -replace=aws_instance.web
```

🔄 **Only runs once** — after that, no need to untaint or clean anything manually.

🧠 **Why use `-replace` instead of `taint`?**

* No need to mark/unmark
* One-step action
* Clear and safe

## 📝 Summary

| Command                        | Purpose                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `terraform taint`              | Mark resource for recreation   |
| `terraform untaint`            | Remove taint flag              |
| `terraform apply -replace=...` | Replace resource in one step ✅ |

No worries, Konka! Let’s dive into **`tfsec`**, the right tool ✅

---

### 🔍 What is `tfsec`?

**`tfsec`** is a **static analysis security scanner** for Terraform code.

It scans your `.tf` files for:

* **Security misconfigurations**
* **Insecure resource definitions**
* **Best practice violations**

---

### 🚀 Why Use `tfsec`?

| ✅ Benefit           | 🔎 Description                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Security-focused    | Detects public S3 buckets, wide-open SGs, etc.   |
| Lightweight         | Fast to run, no dependencies on cloud account    |
| CI/CD Integration   | Works great with GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins |
| Custom Rule Support | You can define your own security rules if needed |
| Module-aware        | It understands and scans used modules as well    |

---

### 📦 Installation

#### Mac:

```bash
brew install tfsec
```

#### Windows (via Chocolatey):

```bash
choco install tfsec
```

#### Docker:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/src" aquasec/tfsec /src
```

---

### ▶️ Basic Usage

```bash
tfsec .
```

It will scan all `.tf` files in the current directory and subfolders.

---

### 📄 Example Output

```txt
  [AWS001][MEDIUM] Resource 'aws_s3_bucket' defines an ACL that allows public READ access.

  ./main.tf:2
     2 | resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mybucket" {
     3 |   acl = "public-read"
```

This means your S3 bucket is publicly readable — a security risk.

---

### 🔁 Use in CI/CD – GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
- name: Run tfsec
  uses: aquasecurity/tfsec-action@v1.0.0
```

---

### 🔒 Common Security Checks

| Rule ID | What it Catches                   |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| AWS001  | S3 bucket is public               |
| AWS017  | SG allows 0.0.0.0/0 on port 22    |
| AWS065  | EBS volume not encrypted          |
| GCP003  | Cloud SQL database not encrypted  |
| AZU005  | Azure storage account allows HTTP |

---

### 🧠 Best Practices

* Run `tfsec` **before every apply**
* Add it to your **CI/CD** for every PR
* Combine with `tflint` (linting) + `terraform validate` (syntax)

---

### ✅ Summary

| Tool      | Purpose                     |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| `tfsec`   | Security analysis           |
| `tflint`  | Linting and syntax rules    |
| `checkov` | Policy-as-code + compliance |
