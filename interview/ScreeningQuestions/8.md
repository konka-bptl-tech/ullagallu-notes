# Why Do you have career gap

After completing my graduation in 2015, I initially pursued a career as a Java developer. I dedicated time to learning Core Java, Advanced Java, Spring, Hibernate, and MySQL. During this period, I actively applied for jobs and attended several interviews. While I did get a few opportunities, some didn't work out due to performance, and many were impacted by eligibility criteria, especially because of my academic percentage being below 60%.

Despite the setbacks, I remained committed to my goal. However, in mid-2016, my father met with an accident, and I had to step in to manage our family business. This unexpected responsibility led to a career gap, as my focus shifted entirely to supporting my family during a difficult time.

Even during this period, I stayed connected with the tech industry through my peers and friends. They advised me that given the career gap, transitioning into development might be difficult and suggested I explore cloud and DevOps technologies. I took this advice seriously and found the domain both promising and aligned with my interests.

My earlier experience with Java, particularly working with logic, conditions, and loops, proved to be a strong foundation when I started learning Bash scripting, scripted pipelines, and Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform. Since then, Iâ€™ve been actively reskilling and preparing myself for a career in AWS and DevOps.
