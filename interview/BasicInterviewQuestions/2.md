### ❓ **“What are your day-to-day activities as a DevOps Engineer?”**

---

> On a daily basis, I focus on ensuring that the infrastructure and deployment processes run smoothly.
>
> I manage and maintain our AWS cloud infrastructure using Terraform for provisioning and updating resources. I regularly monitor the performance of services like EC2, ECS, EKS, and RDS, and handle any incidents or alerts.
>
> I work with CI/CD pipelines—mostly using GitHub Actions and Jenkins—to automate application deployments and rollbacks. I also handle Docker image builds, versioning, and pushing them to container registries.
>
> I review and update Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts and manage configuration changes through version control.
>
> On the monitoring side, I check dashboards in Grafana, troubleshoot logs using the ELK stack or CloudWatch, and work with the development team if any issue arises in staging or production.
>
> Apart from operational tasks, I spend time improving automation, writing scripts, optimizing infrastructure cost, and exploring new tools like Istio or Azure.
