## ✅ **1. Git Feature Branch Workflow (Used in Agile Teams)**

### 🔹 Where you can say you used this:

> "In my current project where we follow Scrum, we use a feature branching strategy to manage development."

### 🔸 How to explain:

> We follow a **feature branch strategy**, where the `main` or `master` branch always holds stable production-ready code.
>
> For every new task or user story, we create a separate **feature branch** from `develop`, named like `feature/login-api` or `feature/payment-module`.
>
> Once the development and testing are done, we raise a **pull request (PR)** and get it reviewed and merged into the `develop` branch.
>
> The QA team tests from the `develop` branch. After successful UAT, we create a **release branch** like `release/v1.2`, test it, and finally merge it into `main` and tag it with a version.

## ✅ **2. Gitflow Workflow (Ideal for Microservices or Big Releases)**

### 🔹 Where you can say you used this:

> "In another project where we had a microservices architecture and scheduled releases, we used a Gitflow strategy for better control."

### 🔸 How to explain:

> In this strategy, we have 5 types of branches:
>
> * `main` – for production code
> * `develop` – for integration/testing
> * `feature/*` – for new features
> * `release/*` – for staging/UAT
> * `hotfix/*` – for urgent production bug fixes
>
> Developers branch off from `develop` to work on features. After merging features, we create a `release` branch from `develop` and deploy it to staging. Once QA signs off, we merge `release` into both `main` and `develop`.
>
> For critical production bugs, we create a `hotfix` from `main`, fix the issue, and then merge it into both `main` and `develop` to keep everything in sync.

### 🧠 Pro Tip for Interview:

You can say:

> “I’ve worked with both Feature Branching and Gitflow strategies. Based on the team's release model, we chose the appropriate one. For agile and fast-paced changes, we used feature branching. For planned releases with versioning and multiple environments, Gitflow gave us better control.”
