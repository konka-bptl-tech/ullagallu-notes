## ❓ **“What’s your Kubernetes cluster size?”**

### ✅ **Sample Answer:**

> In our EKS environment, we maintain **multiple clusters** based on environments—dev, staging, and production.
>
> The **production cluster** is the largest, with around **10 nodes** using **managed node groups** and **Karpenter** for dynamic scaling. Each node has around **4 vCPUs and 16 GB RAM**.
>
> On average, the cluster runs around **50–60 pods**, including application pods, service mesh (Istio) components, monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana), and logging components (Fluent Bit, Elasticsearch).
>
> For dev and staging, the clusters are smaller—around **3 to 5 nodes**—just enough to replicate production for testing.
>
> We use **auto-scaling** for both nodes and pods, and keep an eye on resource utilization using **Prometheus metrics** and **Kubernetes HPA/VPA**.

### 🧠 Bonus Tip for Interview:

If you're unsure of exact numbers, say:

> “Cluster sizes vary by environment. In production, we usually scale between 8 to 12 nodes depending on load, and we use autoscaling tools like Karpenter and HPA to handle peak traffic efficiently.”
