## ❓ **“Can you explain a recent challenge you faced?”**

### ✅ **Sample Answer (Based on Your Experience)**

> One of the recent challenges I faced was during the **migration of Ingress from NGINX to Istio Gateway** in our Kubernetes project.
>
> The application was already running on EKS with NGINX Ingress, but we had to shift to Istio to enable service mesh features like traffic routing, mTLS, and observability.
>
> The challenge was that **Istio’s Gateway and VirtualService configurations were completely different** from traditional Ingress. Also, we had to manage port configurations carefully to avoid conflicts with existing services.
>
> I took a step-by-step approach—first deploying the Istio control plane, configuring Gateway and VirtualServices, and then gradually migrating one service at a time using traffic splitting. I also had to troubleshoot **issues with DNS resolution**, and **health checks failing** due to missing annotations or mismatched ports.
>
> It took time and trial-and-error, but I was able to successfully migrate without downtime, and now the platform supports canary deployments and secure internal traffic.
>
> I learned a lot about **Istio internals**, advanced **Kubernetes networking**, and how to plan a **zero-downtime migration**.
