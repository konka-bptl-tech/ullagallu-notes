## âœ… **Project 1: 3-Tier Application Migration to Serverless**

> In this project, I worked on modernizing a traditional 3-tier application that was originally hosted on virtual machines.
>
> I was responsible for **migrating the entire infrastructure to AWS using Terraform**. The application has:
>
> * **Frontend** hosted in an **S3 bucket** with static website hosting and **CloudFront** as CDN.
> * **Backend API** containerized and deployed on **ECS (Fargate)** with Application Load Balancer.
> * **Database layer** hosted in **RDS (PostgreSQL)**.
>
> I also implemented **IAM roles and policies**, **VPC setup with subnets and route tables**, and configured **security groups** to ensure secure communication.
>
> For CI/CD, I used **GitHub Actions** to automate infrastructure deployment and application rollout.
>
> We added monitoring using **CloudWatch logs and metrics**, and enabled **backup and disaster recovery** for RDS.
>
> This project helped reduce operational overhead and cost, and we achieved a fully serverless and scalable architecture.

## âœ… **Project 2: Kubernetes Platform Engineering**

> In this project, I was involved in setting up and managing Kubernetes-based deployments.
>
> I worked on **provisioning EKS clusters using Terraform**, and managed **node groups, Ingress controllers, and Istio service mesh** for traffic control.
>
> I containerized applications using **Docker**, and deployed them using **Helm charts** for consistent version-controlled releases.
>
> I also implemented **monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana**, and log collection with **ELK stack**.
>
> For CI/CD, I used both **GitHub Actions** and **Argo CD** to automate application delivery. I also handled **Kubernetes upgrades**, managed **secrets** with AWS Secrets Manager, and ensured pod security using **network policies and RBAC**.

## ðŸ§  How to say in interview:

> "Iâ€™ve worked on two major projects. One is a 3-tier application that we migrated from VMs to a complete serverless architecture on AWS using S3, ECS Fargate, and RDS. I handled infrastructure with Terraform and built the CI/CD pipeline.
>
> The second project is based on Kubernetes where I managed EKS clusters, automated deployments using Helm and Argo CD, and implemented observability with Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack."
