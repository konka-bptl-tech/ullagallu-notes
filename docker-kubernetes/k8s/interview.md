1. Your pod keeps getting stuck in CrashLoopBackOff, but logs show no errors. How would you approach debugging and resolution?

2. You have a StatefulSet deployed with persistent volumes, and one of the pods is not recreating properly after deletion. What could be the reasons, and how do you fix it without data loss?

3. Your cluster autoscaler is not scaling up even though pods are in Pending state. What would you investigate?

4. A network policy is blocking traffic between services in different namespaces. How would you design and debug the policy to allow only specific communication paths?

5. One of your microservices has to connect to an external database via a VPN inside the cluster. How would you architect this in Kubernetes with HA and security in mind?

6. You're running a multi-tenant platform on a single EKS cluster. How do you isolate workloads and ensure security, quotas, and observability for each tenant?

7. You notice the kubelet is constantly restarting on a particular node. What steps would you take to isolate the issue and ensure node stability?

8. A critical pod in production gets evicted due to node pressure. How would you prevent this from happening again, and how do QoS classes play a role?

9. You need to deploy a service that requires TCP and UDP on the same port. How would you configure this in Kubernetes using Services and Ingress?

10. An application upgrade caused downtime even though you had rolling updates configured. What advanced strategies would you apply to ensure zero-downtime deployments next time?

11. Your service mesh sidecar (e.g., Istio Envoy) is consuming more resources than the app itself. How do you analyze and optimize this setup?

12. You need to create a Kubernetes operator to automate complex application lifecycle events. How do you design the CRD and controller loop logic?

13. Multiple nodes are showing high disk IO usage due to container logs. What Kubernetes features or practices can you apply to avoid this scenario?

14. Your Kubernetes cluster's etcd performance is degrading. What are the root causes and how do you ensure etcd high availability and tuning?

15. You want to enforce that all images used in the cluster must come from a trusted internal registry. How do you implement this at the policy level?

16. You're managing multi-region deployments using a single Kubernetes control plane. What architectural considerations must you address to avoid cross-region latency and single points of failure?

17. During peak traffic, your ingress controller fails to route requests efficiently. How would you diagnose and scale ingress resources effectively under heavy load?


 1. Your cluster’s API server is responding slowly, impacting other components.
 How would you diagnose and resolve API server performance bottlenecks?
 What are the common causes of high API server latency?

2. A pod is stuck waiting for its Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to be bound.
 How do you debug and resolve PVC binding issues?
 What are the key considerations when provisioning storage dynamically in Kubernetes?

3. Your application is set up with a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), but scaling is not happening even under high load.
 How would you troubleshoot why the HPA is not scaling the pods?
 What are the prerequisites for HPA to function properly?

4. You need to configure a Kubernetes cluster for multi-tenancy to isolate workloads from different teams.
 How would you implement multi-tenancy in Kubernetes?
 What tools or features would you use to enforce resource isolation and security?

5. A namespace in your cluster has reached its resource quota, and new pods can’t be scheduled.
 How would you diagnose and resolve the issue?
 What strategies can you implement to avoid such resource exhaustion in the future?

6. Your application pods are taking too long to start.
 What could be causing the slow startup, and how would you debug the issue?
 How do liveness and readiness probes impact pod startup?

7. Pods in your cluster are unable to resolve external domain names.
 How would you debug and resolve DNS resolution failures in Kubernetes?
 What are the key components involved in DNS resolution in a Kubernetes cluster?

8. Your team decides to implement a service mesh for better observability, security, and traffic control between microservices.
 How would you introduce a service mesh like Istio or Linkerd into your Kubernetes environment?
 What challenges would you expect during implementation, and how would you address them?

9. You are deploying a stateful application, such as a database, on Kubernetes.
 What are the key differences between StatefulSets and Deployments, and why would you choose one over the other?
 How do you handle scaling and backups for stateful workloads?

10. Your security team mandates that only images from a trusted private registry can be used in your Kubernetes cluster.
