## ‚úÖ **Challenges with Pod Communication in Kubernetes**

1. **Pod IP is Ephemeral**

   * Pod IP changes every time the pod restarts.
   * You cannot rely on Pod IP for stable communication.

2. **No Load Balancing Between Pods**

   * There's no built-in load balancing if you're accessing individual Pod IPs.

3. **Network Policies Can Block Traffic**

   * Communication between pods can be restricted if `NetworkPolicies` are enforced.

## ‚úÖ **How Kubernetes Solves This: Services**

A **Service** is a stable Kubernetes object that **exposes a group of Pods** as a **network endpoint**, even if the underlying pods change.

### Key Points:

* **Stable communication layer** on top of ephemeral Pods.
* **Service and Pods are decoupled**, so services remain functional even if pods are recreated.
* Provides a **stable IP** (ClusterIP) and a **DNS name**.
* Performs **load balancing** among matched Pods.
* Creates **DNS entries** via `kube-dns` or `CoreDNS`.

### üß† **How Services Know Which Pods to Route To?**

* `EndpointsSlice` Controller watches the Service's **label selector**.
* It finds matching pods and maintains the list of healthy endpoints.
* This enables dynamic updates ‚Äî new pods are added, terminated pods are removed.

### üß± **Types of Kubernetes Services**

| Type           | Description                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ClusterIP`    | Default type. Accessible only **within** the cluster.                                                  |
| `NodePort`     | Exposes the service **externally** on each node‚Äôs IP at a fixed port.                                  |
| `LoadBalancer` | Uses a **cloud provider's** Load Balancer to expose the service to the internet.                       |
| `ExternalName` | Maps service to an **external CNAME/DNS**. No selectors used.                                          |
| `Headless`     | (`ClusterIP: None`) Used when you want to access individual pod IPs directly. Useful for StatefulSets. |

### üí° LoadBalancer Internal Flow

```
External LB --> NodeIP:NodePort --> ServiceIP:ServicePort --> PodIP:PodPort
```

> Drawback: For each service exposed via LoadBalancer, you consume a separate LB resource (costly in cloud).

## üîß **Kube-Proxy's Role**

* **Kube-proxy** runs on every node.
* It watches the `Service` and `Endpoints` objects.
* Creates **iptables** or **IPVS rules** to route traffic to the correct Pod IPs.
* Performs **round-robin load balancing** at the node level.
* Handles NAT and forwards external traffic to the correct internal pod.

## üîç **DNS Naming**

Services can be accessed with their internal DNS:

```
<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
```

Example:

```
nginx-service.default.svc.cluster.local
```

---

## üîß `kubectl` Commands

```bash
# List all services in the current namespace
kubectl get svc

# Describe a service to see selectors, ports, and endpoints
kubectl describe svc <service-name>

# Get endpoints for a service
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>

# Create a service (ClusterIP) quickly
kubectl expose pod my-pod --port=80 --target-port=8080 --name=my-service

# Port-forward service to access locally
kubectl port-forward svc/my-service 8080:80
```
