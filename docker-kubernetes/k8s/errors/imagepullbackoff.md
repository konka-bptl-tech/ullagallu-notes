The `ImagePullBackOff` error in Kubernetes means that **Kubernetes is unable to pull the container image** from the image registry. It typically follows a failed image pull attempt (`ErrImagePull`), and Kubernetes goes into a **back-off** mode trying again.

## 🔍 **Common Reasons for `ImagePullBackOff`**

| Reason                        | Description                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ **Incorrect image name**    | Typo or wrong image tag (e.g., `myapp:latest` doesn't exist).             |
| 🔐 **Private image registry** | Image requires authentication and no image pull secret provided.          |
| 🐳 **Image doesn’t exist**    | You’re referencing a non-existent image in Docker Hub or custom registry. |
| 🌐 **Network/DNS issues**     | Cluster cannot reach registry (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR, GCR).               |
| ⏱️ **Registry rate limits**   | Docker Hub may throttle pulls if rate limits are exceeded.                |

## 🛠️ **How to Troubleshoot `ImagePullBackOff`**

### 1. 📋 Check Pod Status

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

### 2. 📜 Describe the Pod

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

Check the **Events** section for messages like:

```
Failed to pull image "myapp:latest": rpc error: ...
Error: ErrImagePull
Back-off pulling image "myapp:latest"
```

This tells you the root cause.

## ✅ **Fixes Based on Root Cause**

### 1. ✅ **Fix Image Name/Tag**

* Double-check image name and tag in your Deployment or Pod spec.

```yaml
image: nginx:1.25.3  # <- Make sure this tag exists
```

### 2. 🔐 **Private Registry: Add ImagePullSecrets**

If pulling from private DockerHub, AWS ECR, GitHub Container Registry, etc.

#### Create a secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry myregistrykey \
  --docker-server=<registry-url> \
  --docker-username=<username> \
  --docker-password=<password> \
  --docker-email=<email>
```

#### Reference it in your Pod/Deployment:

```yaml
spec:
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: myregistrykey
```

### 3. 🌐 **Check Network Access**

* From inside a running pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it <some-other-pod> -- curl https://registry.hub.docker.com
```

* Ensure your cluster has internet access or DNS isn't broken.

### 4. 🔁 **Retry Later (Rate Limits)**

* Docker Hub enforces pull limits for anonymous and free accounts.
* Use authenticated pull or host your own registry.

## 🧪 Optional: Test Pulling the Image Manually

Try pulling the image locally with Docker:

```bash
docker pull <image-name>
```

This helps catch:

* Typos
* Private image access issues
