The `CrashLoopBackOff` error in Kubernetes means that a container in a pod is **repeatedly crashing** and Kubernetes is **trying to restart it**, but it fails over and over.

## 🔍 **Common Reasons for `CrashLoopBackOff`**

1. ### 🛑 **Application Crashes**

   * Your app exits immediately due to a bug, exception, or unhandled error.
   * Example: Python app raises an exception on startup and exits.

2. ### 🕒 **Slow Start with Readiness/Liveness Probe Failures**

   * App is slow to start and fails health checks.
   * Liveness probe kills it repeatedly.

3. ### 📂 **Missing Configs or Secrets**

   * Missing or misconfigured ConfigMap, Secret, or environment variables.
   * App fails to start due to missing required configs.

4. ### 🔄 **Crash Due to Invalid Command or Entry Point**

   * Misconfigured container command or entrypoint in the YAML.

5. ### 🔐 **Permission Issues**

   * The app doesn’t have required file access, or volume mount issues.

6. ### 🔁 **Dependencies Not Ready**

   * App tries to connect to DB/cache that isn’t up yet and exits.

7. ### 📈 **Out of Resources**

   * Container is OOMKilled (Out Of Memory).
   * CPU/memory limits too low.

## 🛠️ **How to Troubleshoot `CrashLoopBackOff`**

1. ### 📋 **Check Pod Status**

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

2. ### 📜 **Check Container Logs**

   ```bash
   kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous
   ```

   > Use `--previous` to see logs of the **crashed** container.

3. ### 🔍 **Describe the Pod**

   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
   ```

   * Look at **events**, restart count, and any probe failures.

4. ### 🧪 **Check Liveness and Readiness Probes**

   * In the YAML, verify if liveness/readiness probe thresholds are too strict.

5. ### 🔐 **Check Secrets and ConfigMaps**

   ```bash
   kubectl get secrets
   kubectl get configmaps
   ```

   * Ensure mounted correctly.

6. ### 📂 **Check Mounted Volumes**

   * Ensure paths used by the app actually exist and are accessible.

7. ### 📈 **Check Resource Limits**

   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
   ```

   * Look for `OOMKilled` messages.

8. ### 🛠️ **Try Running the Container Locally**

   ```bash
   docker run -it <image-name> /bin/sh
   ```

   * Helps debug entrypoint/command issues or missing dependencies.

9. ### 🧪 **Use `kubectl exec` to Inspect a Running Pod (if it stays up briefly)**

   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh
   ```

| Issue                    | Suggested Fix                                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| App crashes              | Fix code bug or handle exceptions                    |
| Probes fail              | Adjust `initialDelaySeconds`, `timeoutSeconds`, etc. |
| Configs/secrets missing  | Check and correctly mount `ConfigMap` or `Secret`    |
| Wrong entrypoint/command | Check `command` and `args` in deployment YAML        |
| Dependency not ready     | Add readiness checks or retries in app logic         |
| Resource limits          | Increase memory/CPU limits in pod spec               |
