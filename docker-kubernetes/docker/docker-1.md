# Containerization
### 🗣️ **Polished Answer (based on your sentence):**
> **“Containerization is the process of bundling an application along with its dependencies, required libraries, and a minimal OS into a single unit. This ensures the app runs reliably and consistently in any environment — whether it’s development, staging, or production.”**
---
### 🔧 Breakdown (in your style):
1. ✅ **Bundle the application**
2. ✅ **Include only required dependencies and libraries**
3. ✅ **Use a lightweight OS layer (not full OS)**
4. ✅ **Run the same way everywhere**
---
### 💡 How to Make It Sound Confident:
> “I use containerization to avoid setup issues across environments. By packaging the app, libraries, and even a minimal OS layer into a container, I ensure it runs exactly the same everywhere. It’s efficient, fast to start, and easy to manage.”
