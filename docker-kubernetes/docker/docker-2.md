### 🧱 Dockerfile – Set of Instructions to Build an Image (Konka Style)
> Dockerfile is a **set of instructions** that tells Docker **how to build an image**.
---
### 🧩 Common Dockerfile Instructions:
* **`FROM`** → defines the **base image**
  *Example: `FROM ubuntu:20.04`*
* **`RUN`** → used to **install packages**, run shell commands
  *Example: `RUN apt-get install -y nginx`*
* **`WORKDIR`** → sets the **working directory** inside the image
  *Example: `WORKDIR /app`*
* **`USER`** → The USER instruction sets which user the container should use to run following instructions or to run the container process
  *Example: `USER appuser`*
* **`COPY`** → **copies files** from local system to image build context
  *Example: `COPY . /app`*
* **`ADD`** → like `COPY`, but can also **download from remote URL** and **auto-untar** archives
* **`CMD`** → defines the **default command** to run when the container starts
  *Can be overridden at runtime.*
* **`ENTRYPOINT`** → also defines what runs when container starts
  *Can’t be overridden unless `--entrypoint` is passed.*
* **`EXPOSE`** → documents which **port the container will listen on**
---
### 📌 Key Differences:
| CMD vs ENTRYPOINT                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CMD` can be overridden by `docker run <image> <new command>`  |
| `ENTRYPOINT` stays fixed unless overridden with `--entrypoint` |
---
### 🧱 Docker Build Process (Layered)
* **Each instruction** in Dockerfile creates a **new immutable layer**.
* These layers form a **layered filesystem**, and Docker uses **layer caching** to avoid rebuilding unchanged layers.
---
### 🧠 Example:
If you have 4 instructions:
```
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get install -y python3
COPY . /app
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```
Docker creates **4 separate layers**.
* On the next build, if nothing changed, Docker uses **cached layers** — build is fast.
* If instruction 2 (`RUN`) changes, then Docker rebuilds **layer 2, 3, and 4** again — because layers are built in order.
---
### ✅ Best Practice:
> **Keep frequently-changing instructions at the bottom** and **rarely-changing ones at the top** to maximize layer caching.
So:
* Put `FROM`, `RUN apt update`, `pip install`, etc. **at the top**
* Put `COPY . /app` and `CMD` **at the bottom** (these change often)
---
### 🔊 Konka's One-liner:
> “Each Dockerfile instruction builds a layer. Docker uses layer caching to speed up builds. So we should order our instructions from least changing to most changing.”
---
Nice, Konka — with 4.5 years of experience, you should explain **CMD vs ENTRYPOINT** clearly, confidently, and with a **real-world feel**.
Here’s how **you** can explain it — keeping it **simple, technical, and impactful**:
---
### ✅ Konka's Interview Explanation – CMD vs ENTRYPOINT
> “Both `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` are used to define **what should run when a container starts**, but they behave differently.”
---
### 🔍 Key Difference:
| CMD                                 | ENTRYPOINT                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Acts like a **default argument**    | Acts like a **fixed command**                          |
| **Can be overridden** at runtime    | **Cannot be overridden** unless you use `--entrypoint` |
| Used when the container is flexible | Used when the container always runs one main thing     |
---
### 🔧 Example:
#### 1. Using `CMD`:
```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
CMD ["echo", "Hello"]
```
```bash
docker run myimage         # ➜ Hello
docker run myimage Hi      # ➜ Hi ← CMD gets overridden
```
#### 2. Using `ENTRYPOINT`:
```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
```
```bash
docker run myimage Hello   # ➜ Hello
docker run myimage Hi      # ➜ Hi
```
Now if you try to override with a different command:
```bash
docker run myimage ls      # ➜ will still execute: echo ls
```
It **won’t run `ls`**, it’ll still use `echo`.
---
### 🤓 In Real Projects (Konka Style):
> “In my experience, I use `ENTRYPOINT` when the container always runs one specific app — like a `nginx`, or a custom binary. I use `CMD` when I want to give default args — like running a Python script, but allowing override.”
---
### 🔊 Final One-Liner for Interview:
> “`CMD` is flexible and can be overridden. `ENTRYPOINT` is fixed and always runs. For production apps, I usually combine both — use `ENTRYPOINT` to lock the command, and `CMD` to pass default arguments.”
---
### 🧠 CMD Forms – Exec vs Shell (Konka Style)
> In Docker, `CMD` can be written in two formats: **exec form** and **shell form**. Both define what should run when the container starts — but they behave differently.
---
### ✅ Exec Form
```Dockerfile
CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
```
* This is **JSON array syntax**.
* It directly executes the command **without** starting a shell.
* No `/bin/sh` is involved.
* Preferred in production — less overhead, better signal handling.
🔹 Example:
```Dockerfile
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
This runs the `nginx` process **directly**.
---
### 🐚 Shell Form
```Dockerfile
CMD command param1 param2
```
* This runs the command **inside a shell** (`/bin/sh -c`).
* Extra shell layer is created.
* You can use shell features like environment variables, `&&`, `|`, etc.
🔹 Example:
```Dockerfile
CMD echo Hello && ls
```
This is the same as:
```bash
/bin/sh -c "echo Hello && ls"
```
---
### 💡 Key Differences:
| Aspect             | Exec Form                | Shell Form                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Syntax             | JSON array               | Plain string                   |
| Uses shell?        | ❌ No shell (`/bin/sh`)   | ✅ Yes, uses `/bin/sh -c`       |
| Signal handling    | ✅ Proper signal handling | ❌ May not forward signals well |
| Use shell features | ❌ No                     | ✅ Yes (like `&&`, env vars)    |
---
### 🔊 Konka’s One-liner:
> “Exec form runs the command directly — good for signal handling and clean execution. Shell form creates a shell process — useful if I need shell tricks like `&&`, `env vars`, or loops.
---
### 🧱 What is Multi-Stage Docker Build?
> **Multi-stage build** means using **multiple `FROM` statements** in a single Dockerfile to create **cleaner and smaller images**.
---
### 🔧 Why Use It?
* To **avoid shipping unnecessary files/tools** (like build-time dependencies) into your final image.
* To **reduce image size** and improve security.
* To **separate build and run environments**.
---
### 🛠️ Example: Build a Go App (Two Stages)
```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build stage
FROM golang:1.21 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp
# Stage 2: Final image
FROM alpine:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp .
CMD ["./myapp"]
```
---
### 🔍 What Happens Here?
1. **Stage 1 (builder)**
   * Uses `golang` image to build the app
   * Output: `myapp` binary
2. **Stage 2 (final image)**
   * Starts fresh with **Alpine** (small OS)
   * Only copies the final binary from the previous stage
   * No source code, no Go compiler — only what’s needed to run
---
### ✅ Benefits:
| Feature            | Why it's Good                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Smaller image size | No compilers, temp files, etc.               |
| More secure        | Less attack surface                          |
| Clean separation   | Build tools in one stage, runtime in another |
| Easy to manage     | All in one Dockerfile                        |
---
### 🔊 Konka’s One-Liner for Interview:
> “Multi-stage builds help me separate the build environment from the final runtime. This keeps my image clean, small, and production-ready without extra files or tools.”
---
### 📝 **Note: CMD vs ENTRYPOINT vs RUN**
* **`CMD`** and **`ENTRYPOINT`**
  → These instructions are executed **when the container starts**
  → They define **what should run inside the container**
* **`RUN`**
  → Executes **during the image build** process
  → Used to install packages, update files, configure the image
---
### 🔧 Example:
```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx     # Runs during build
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]                 # Runs when container starts
```
---
### 🔊 Summary Line:
> `RUN` is for **building the image**, while `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` are for **running the container**.
---
### 🗑️ **What are Dangling Images?**
> **Dangling images** are images **not tagged** and **not used by any container**.
> They are usually leftovers from failed builds or intermediate layers from multi-stage builds.
You can identify them easily:
```bash
docker images -f dangling=true
```
They’ll look like:
```
<none>    <none>    ...
```
---
### 🧹 **How to Clean Up Dangling Images**
```bash
docker image prune
```
* This removes **only dangling images**
* Safe to run — won’t touch used or tagged images
You can also clean **dangling + unused** images:
```bash
docker image prune -a
```
---
### 🧼 **Full Cleanup Commands (Bonus)**
| Task                            | Command                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Remove **dangling images**      | `docker image prune`     |
| Remove **all unused images**    | `docker image prune -a`  |
| Remove **unused volumes**       | `docker volume prune`    |
| Remove **unused networks**      | `docker network prune`   |
| Remove **stopped containers**   | `docker container prune` |
| Remove **everything (careful)** | `docker system prune -a` |
---
### 🧾 **What is `docker system df`?**
> Shows how much **disk space** is used by Docker — images, containers, volumes, etc.
```bash
docker system df
```
You'll get output like:
```
TYPE            TOTAL     ACTIVE    SIZE      RECLAIMABLE
Images          10        5         2.5GB     1.2GB
Containers      6         2         300MB     100MB
Volumes         3         2         500MB     200MB
Build Cache     -         -         100MB     100MB
```
It helps you **decide what to clean** if space is low.
---
### 🔊 Konka’s One-Liner:
> “Dangling images are unused, untagged leftovers. I clean them with `docker image prune`. To check Docker disk usage, I use `docker system df`.”
---
### 🧩 **What is Docker Compose? (Konka Style)**
> Docker Compose is a tool used to **run multiple containers at once** using a simple **YAML file**.
---
### 📦 Why Docker Compose?
* When you have a multi-container app (like frontend, backend, DB), running them manually with `docker run` becomes hard.
* With Compose, you define **all containers and configs in one file**, and bring them up with one command.
---
### 💡 Example: 3-Tier App
Let’s say you have:
* Frontend (React)
* Backend (Node.js)
* Database (MySQL)
With Compose, you define all in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  frontend:
    image: my-frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - backend

  backend:
    image: my-backend
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: mysql:8
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
```
Then just run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
All 3 containers start together — properly linked.
---
### ✅ Benefits:
* Easy to manage multi-container apps
* Networking is built-in (they talk via service names)
* Supports environment variables, volume mounts, healthchecks
* `depends_on` helps manage container startup order
---
### 🔧 Common Commands:
| Task                 | Command                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Start all containers | `docker-compose up -d`   |
| Stop all containers  | `docker-compose down`    |
| View logs            | `docker-compose logs -f` |
| Rebuild images       | `docker-compose build`   |
---
### 🔊 Konka's Interview Line:
> “I use Docker Compose to manage multi-container apps. I define each service in a YAML file and can bring up the full stack with one command. It simplifies networking, linking, and orchestration of containers.”
