## ✅ What is `git stash`?
We did some work and that work is not require for now so we use
> `git stash` temporarily saves your **uncommitted changes** (both staged and unstaged) and reverts your working directory to match the last commit — like hitting "pause" on your work.

---

## 📌 Basic Usage

### 🧹 Stash your current changes:

```bash
git stash
```

This will:

* Save the changes
* Clean your working directory (as if nothing was changed)

### 🔍 See stashed items:

```bash
git stash list
```

Example:

```
stash@{0}: WIP on main: 27ae9b1 Add db config
stash@{1}: WIP on main: e9d12f4 Update README
```

### 👇 Apply the last stashed changes:

```bash
git stash apply
```

> If you want to apply a specific stash:

```bash
git stash apply stash@{1}
```

### ✅ Apply and **remove** it from the stash:

```bash
git stash pop
```

> Same as `apply`, but also deletes the stash entry.

---

## 🗑️ Delete stash manually:

* Delete one:

```bash
git stash drop stash@{0}
```

* Delete all:

```bash
git stash clear
```

---

## 💡 Example Workflow:

```bash
# 1. Make changes to files
vim main.tf

# 2. Need to switch branch but don’t want to commit?
git stash

# 3. Now working directory is clean
git checkout another-branch

# 4. Come back and resume work
git checkout main
git stash pop
```

## 📁 What does `git stash` include?

| File Type        | Stashed?                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Staged changes   | ✅ Yes                            |
| Unstaged changes | ✅ Yes                            |
| Untracked files  | ❌ No (use `--include-untracked`) |
| Ignored files    | ❌ No                             |

To stash untracked files too:

```bash
git stash -u  # or --include-untracked
```
---
## ✅ What is `git reset`?

> `git reset` is used to move your HEAD and branch pointer to a different commit, and optionally reset your working directory or staging area (index).

---

## 🧠 There are 3 types of reset:

| Command                         | Affects Staging? | Affects Working Dir? | Common Use                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `git reset --soft`              | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No                 | Undo last commit, keep changes staged            |
| `git reset --mixed` *(default)* | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Yes (unstaged)     | Unstage changes but keep the files               |
| `git reset --hard`              | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Yes (discards all) | ⚠️ DANGEROUS — undo commit + erase local changes |

---

## 📌 Usage Examples

### 1. 🔄 Undo last commit, keep changes in staging:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

> Use when you committed too soon and want to re-commit properly.

---

### 2. 🛠️ Unstage files (but keep your code):

```bash
git reset
# or explicitly:
git reset --mixed HEAD
```

> Like "unstage" button in GUI tools. Very safe.

---

### 3. 💣 Completely wipe all local changes:

```bash
git reset --hard
```

> WARNING: This will discard **everything** that’s not committed.

You can also reset to a specific commit:

```bash
git reset --hard abc1234
```

---

## 🔍 Find the commit hash:

Use:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Then reset to that hash:

```bash
git reset --hard 27ae9b1
```

---

## 🧼 Reset a single file:

### Unstage a file:

```bash
git reset HEAD filename.tf
```

### Discard changes in file (like checkout):

```bash
git checkout -- filename.tf
```

---

## 🔥 Bonus: Undo pushed commit (⚠️ use with caution)

If you've already pushed a commit but want to undo:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push origin main --force
```

> Use only if you're **sure** (and inform your team!) because `--force` rewrites history.

---

## ✅ Summary

| Command                    | Action                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `git reset --soft HEAD~1`  | Undo commit, keep changes staged   |
| `git reset --mixed HEAD~1` | Undo commit, keep changes unstaged |
| `git reset --hard HEAD~1`  | Undo commit & delete all changes   |
| `git reset HEAD filename`  | Unstage a file                     |
| `git checkout -- filename` | Discard changes in file            |

---

## ✅ What is `git revert`?

> `git revert` creates a **new commit** that **undoes the changes** from a previous commit — without changing your Git history.

So instead of "going back in time" like `reset`, it **moves forward**, cleanly reversing changes.

---

## 🧠 When to use it?

* You’ve pushed a commit to GitHub/main branch
* You want to undo its effects without rewriting history
* You're working on a **shared repo** with other team members

---

## 📌 Usage Examples

### 1. 🔁 Revert the latest commit:

```bash
git revert HEAD
```

> This creates a new commit that reverses the last one.

---

### 2. 🔙 Revert a specific commit:

First, get the commit ID:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Then:

```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

Example:

```bash
git revert a3c1d2e
```

---

### 3. 🔄 Revert multiple commits:

```bash
git revert HEAD~2..HEAD
```

> Reverts the last 2 commits, in order.

Or give specific hashes:

```bash
git revert abc123 def456
```

---

### 4. 🚫 Avoid opening editor during revert:

```bash
git revert --no-edit HEAD
```

> Skips the default commit message prompt.

---

## ⚠️ Difference Between `revert` and `reset`

| Feature                | `git reset`                         | `git revert`                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Rewrites history?      | ✅ Yes (changes commit pointer)      | ❌ No (adds new commit)           |
| Safe for shared repos? | ❌ No                                | ✅ Yes                            |
| Keeps old commit?      | ❌ Removed (in hard/mixed reset)     | ✅ Preserved (just reversed)      |
| Example use            | Fixing local mistake before pushing | Undoing something already pushed |

---

## ✅ Summary

| Command                 | Purpose                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git revert HEAD`       | Undo last commit (safe)                                 |
| `git revert <hash>`     | Undo specific commit                                    |
| `git revert --no-edit`  | Skip message editor                                     |
| `git reset` vs `revert` | `reset` rewrites history, `revert` creates a new commit |

## ✅ What is a Git Tag?

> A **Git tag** is a label that points to a specific commit — often used to mark **releases** like `v1.0.0`, `v2.5`, etc.

Tags are **read-only pointers**, unlike branches, and they help you refer to a stable snapshot of your code.

---

## 🧠 Types of Tags

| Type            | Description                                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lightweight** | Just a name pointing to a commit (like a bookmark)       |
| **Annotated**   | Includes metadata (tagger, date, message, GPG-signature) |

---

## 📌 How to Use Git Tags

### 🔖 1. Create a lightweight tag

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
```

### 📝 2. Create an annotated tag

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
```

> `-a` for annotated, `-m` for message

---

### 🔍 3. List all tags

```bash
git tag
```

---

### 🔎 4. Show tag details (for annotated tags)

```bash
git show v1.0.0
```

---

### 🧭 5. Tag a specific commit

First, get commit hash:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Then:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 abc1234 -m "Release v1.0.0"
```

---

### ☁️ 6. Push tags to remote

```bash
git push origin v1.0.0
```

> Or push all tags:

```bash
git push --tags
```

---

### 🧹 7. Delete a tag

* Local:

```bash
git tag -d v1.0.0
```

* Remote:

```bash
git push origin --delete v1.0.0
```

---

## 📦 Tags in Release Management

Git tags are commonly used in:

* CI/CD pipelines to deploy tagged versions
* Docker image tagging
* GitHub Releases (automatically picks tags)

---

## 🧪 Bonus: Checkout a tag (detached HEAD)

```bash
git checkout v1.0.0
```

> You'll be in **detached HEAD** state — changes won't be on a branch unless you create one:

```bash
git checkout -b hotfix-from-v1
```

---

## ✅ Summary

| Task              | Command                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Create tag        | `git tag v1.0.0`                  |
| Annotated tag     | `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "msg"`      |
| List tags         | `git tag`                         |
| Push tag          | `git push origin v1.0.0`          |
| Delete local tag  | `git tag -d v1.0.0`               |
| Delete remote tag | `git push origin --delete v1.0.0` |

## 🔍 What is **GitLeaks**?

> **GitLeaks** is an open-source SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tool that scans your Git repositories for **hardcoded secrets** like:

* AWS keys
* Passwords
* API tokens
* Private keys
* Database credentials

It helps **prevent secret leaks** before they hit production or public repos (especially on GitHub).

---

## ✅ Why Use GitLeaks?

| Reason                       | Benefit                                |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 🕵️‍♂️ Detects secrets early | Prevents accidental exposure           |
| 🧑‍💻 Developer-friendly     | CLI tool, easy to integrate with CI/CD |
| 🔐 Secret policy enforcement | Helps you maintain security compliance |
| 🚨 Scans full history        | Can catch old secrets too              |

---

## ⚙️ How to Use GitLeaks (CLI)

### 🔧 1. Install GitLeaks

#### On Linux/macOS (via Homebrew):

```bash
brew install gitleaks
```

#### On Linux (manual):

```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases/latest/download/gitleaks-linux-amd64 -o gitleaks
chmod +x gitleaks
sudo mv gitleaks /usr/local/bin
```

---

### 🚀 2. Run GitLeaks on your repo

```bash
gitleaks detect
```

* This scans the current repo for known secret patterns.
* By default, it checks the working directory and git history.

---

### 🧾 3. Example output

```json
{
  "description": "AWS Access Key",
  "file": "main.tf",
  "line": "aws_access_key = \"AKIA...\"",
  "rule": "AWS Access Key",
  "commit": "ab12cd3"
}
```

---

### ✅ 4. Custom config (optional)

You can create a `.gitleaks.toml` config file to define:

* Custom regex rules
* Allowlist for safe false positives
* Files or paths to ignore

Run with config:

```bash
gitleaks detect --config .gitleaks.toml
```

---

## 🛡️ GitLeaks in CI/CD (GitHub Actions Example)

```yaml
- name: Run Gitleaks
  uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2
  with:
    config-path: .gitleaks.toml
```

> You can fail the pipeline if any secrets are found.

---

## 🚫 Found a Secret? What to Do:

1. **Rotate it immediately** (e.g., in AWS Secrets Manager)
2. Remove it from code
3. Revoke or delete the compromised secret
4. If it’s already pushed:

   * Use [`git filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) to remove from history
   * Or use [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/)
5. Force push (⚠️ if needed — use cautiously)

## ✅ 1. **Accidentally Committed the Wrong File?**

### 🔄 Undo the last commit (but keep your changes):

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### ❌ Remove file from staging:

```bash
git reset filename.tf
```

---

## ✅ 2. **Pushed Something Wrong?**

### 😱 Undo a pushed commit (⚠️ for solo use only):

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push origin main --force
```

### 👥 In a team? Use **revert** instead:

```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
```

---

## ✅ 3. **“Your branch is behind/or ahead” message?**

### 🔃 Sync with latest remote changes:

```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
```

---

## ✅ 4. **Merge Conflicts**

### 🔎 What to do:

* Git will mark conflict sections in the files like:

  ```
  <<<<<<< HEAD
  your changes
  =======
  incoming changes
  >>>>>>> branch
  ```
* Manually resolve, then:

```bash
git add .
git commit
```

---

## ✅ 5. **Want to Delete a Local or Remote Branch?**

### 🗑️ Delete local branch:

```bash
git branch -d feature-xyz
```

### 🗑️ Delete remote branch:

```bash
git push origin --delete feature-xyz
```

---

## ✅ 6. **Accidentally Deleted a File?**

If committed earlier:

```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- filename.tf
```

If not committed:

```bash
git fsck --lost-found
```

---

## ✅ 7. **Too Many Unwanted Changes? Revert Everything**

⚠️ Wipes uncommitted changes:

```bash
git reset --hard
```

---

## ✅ 8. **Want to Clean Up Untracked Files (like `terraform.tfstate.backup`, `.terraform/`)?**

```bash
git clean -fd
```

> `-f`: force, `-d`: directories

---

## ✅ 9. **Can't Push Because of Protected Branch**

Solution:

* Create a new branch

```bash
git checkout -b fix-quick
git push origin fix-quick
```

* Open a pull request

---

## ✅ 10. **Forgot to Add `.gitignore` Earlier?**

Add `.gitignore`, then:

```bash
git rm -r --cached .terraform
git rm --cached .terraform.lock.hcl
git commit -m "Remove ignored files"
git push
```

---

## ✅ Bonus Git Lifesavers

| Task              | Command             |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Show last commits | `git log --oneline` |
| Show changes      | `git diff`          |
| Undo `git add`    | `git reset`         |
| See what’s staged | `git diff --cached` |
| See stash list    | `git stash list`    |
| Apply stash       | `git stash pop`     |

---

## ✅ Pro Tip: When in doubt, **never use `git reset --hard`** unless you're **100% sure**. Always create a backup branch:

```bash
git checkout -b backup-before-damage
```
