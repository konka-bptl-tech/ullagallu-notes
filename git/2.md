## ✅ Git 3 Working Areas

Git has 3 key working areas:

| Area                                                    | Description                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Working Directory**                                   | The folder on your system where you make changes to files. These are untracked or modified files.                   |
| **Staging Area (Index)**                                | Temporary area where you prepare changes before committing. Only staged changes will be part of the next commit.    |
| **Local Repository**                                    | Stores your committed changes in `.git` folder locally. These commits are not yet sent to the remote (like GitHub). |
| **Remote Repository** (not counted in 3, but important) | GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc. This is where you push your local commits to share with others or backup.           |

## 🔁 Git Flow (From change to push)

Here’s the typical lifecycle:

```
Edit Code (Working Dir) 
  ↓
git add filename  --> Moves to Staging Area
  ↓
git commit -m "message" --> Moves to Local Repository
  ↓
git push origin branch-name --> Sent to Remote Repository
```

## 🔧 Git Basic Commands (To Practice)

| Command                       | Description                                                                |

## 🔁 Practice Task (Do This Now)

1. Create a new directory and initialize Git:

   ```bash
   mkdir git-practice && cd git-practice
   git init
   ```

2. Create a file:

   ```bash
   echo "Hello Git" > hello.txt
   ```

3. Run:

   ```bash
   git status             # See untracked file
   git add hello.txt      # Move to staging
   git status             # Now it's staged
   git commit -m "Initial commit"  # Now saved in local repo
   ```

4. Make a change to the file:

   ```bash
   echo "Second line" >> hello.txt
   git diff               # Shows changes not staged
   git add hello.txt
   git diff --staged      # See what’s ready to commit
   git commit -m "Added second line"
   ```

5. Create GitHub repo and push:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin <your_repo_url>
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## 🧠 Tips to Master Git Basics

* Practice in a dummy folder. Try deleting, modifying, committing.
* Use `git status` **often** to track file states.
* Learn the difference between `git reset`, `git checkout`, and `git revert`.
* Make mistakes! Then learn how to recover using `git log`, `git reflog`, etc.
* Use GitHub to visualize history and pull requests.

## 🧪 Git Reset Lab (Step-by-Step)

### 🎯 Goal:

Understand how `git reset` behaves in different modes by:

* Making 3 commits
* Resetting to previous commits using different flags
* Observing the effects on staging and working directory

---

## 🔧 Lab Setup

1. **Create a folder**

   ```bash
   mkdir git-reset-lab && cd git-reset-lab
   git init
   ```

2. **Create a file and commit it**

   ```bash
   echo "Line 1" > file.txt
   git add file.txt
   git commit -m "Commit 1 - Line 1"
   ```

3. **Make second change and commit**

   ```bash
   echo "Line 2" >> file.txt
   git add file.txt
   git commit -m "Commit 2 - Line 2"
   ```

4. **Make third change and commit**

   ```bash
   echo "Line 3" >> file.txt
   git add file.txt
   git commit -m "Commit 3 - Line 3"
   ```

5. **Check log**

   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

You should see something like:

```
c3xxxx Commit 3 - Line 3
c2xxxx Commit 2 - Line 2
c1xxxx Commit 1 - Line 1
```

Now let’s test the reset commands.

---

## 🧪 Lab 1: `git reset --soft`

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

🔍 What happens:

* HEAD moves back to **Commit 2**
* Changes from **Commit 3** stay **staged**

Run:

```bash
git status
```

✅ You’ll see `file.txt` is **staged** for commit.

---

## 🧪 Lab 2: `git reset` (default is `--mixed`)

```bash
git reset HEAD~1
```

🔍 What happens:

* HEAD moves back to **Commit 1**
* Changes from **Commit 2 and 3** are in working directory but **not staged**

Run:

```bash
git status
```

✅ You’ll see changes are **unstaged** but present in the file.

---

## 🧪 Lab 3: `git reset --hard`

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

🔍 What happens:

* HEAD moves back to **Commit 0** (initial or earlier)
* All changes from **Commit 2 and 3** are **gone**
* No file changes left

Run:

```bash
git status
cat file.txt
```

✅ You’ll see file only has content from **Commit 1**, other changes are gone.

---

## 🛟 Bonus: Recover using `reflog`

```bash
git reflog
```

Find your commit hash of `Commit 3`, then restore:

```bash
git reset --hard <hash_of_commit_3>
```

## ✅ Summary Table for Reset Modes

| Command                    | HEAD moves? | Keeps file changes? | Keeps staged? |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| `git reset --soft`         | ✅           | ✅                   | ✅             |
| `git reset` (or `--mixed`) | ✅           | ✅                   | ❌             |
| `git reset --hard`         | ✅           | ❌                   | ❌             |
