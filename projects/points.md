### ✅ Interview Explanation (Simple and Professional):

**"One of my clients had a 3-tier application architecture fully hosted on virtual machines. This included the frontend and backend on EC2 instances, with MySQL in RDS and Valkey (a Redis alternative) in ElastiCache.**

**I was assigned the responsibility to migrate this setup into a more scalable and serverless architecture. Before initiating the migration, I thoroughly analyzed the existing infrastructure — understanding the role of each component, how services interacted, and where potential bottlenecks existed.**

**Based on this analysis, I proposed a modern serverless architecture:**

* **Frontend moved to S3 with CloudFront as CDN.**
* **Backend containerized and deployed on ECS Fargate to reduce management overhead.**
* **RDS and ElastiCache were retained as they are already managed services.**

**This migration approach improved scalability, reduced operational overhead, and aligned with AWS best practices for serverless solutions."**
