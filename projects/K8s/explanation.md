## ✅ **Opening (Project Overview)**

*"I’m currently working as a DevOps Engineer on a platform where we manage **70+ microservices hosted in Amazon EKS**. The architecture is built for scalability and security. We use a modern DevOps toolchain including **Jenkins, ArgoCD, Terraform, Istio, Vault, Prometheus, and ELK stack**. Our infrastructure is hosted on **AWS across five environments – Dev, Test, UAT, Pre-Prod, and Prod**, under a secured multi-account structure with AWS Organizations."*

## ✅ **Cluster Upgrade (STAR Method)**

**S**: We had to upgrade our EKS clusters from version 1.27 to 1.29 for security and compatibility.
**T**: The goal was to ensure a zero-downtime upgrade across all environments without breaking microservices.
**A**: I created a detailed upgrade plan:

* Validated all Helm charts compatibility
* Used `eksctl` and Terraform for blue-green cluster setup
* Migrated workloads gradually using canary deployments
* Ran pre/post-upgrade validation scripts
  **R**: Successfully upgraded all clusters with **zero downtime** and no production impact. The entire operation was completed in **50% less time** than previous upgrades by using automation scripts.

---

## ✅ **Write Shared Libraries (STAR Method)**

**S**: We had redundant Jenkins pipeline code across teams (Java, Node.js, Python).
**T**: My task was to centralize and standardize them.
**A**:

* Created Jenkins shared libraries with functions for build, test, scan, and deploy.
* Parameterized pipeline logic for different tech stacks.
* Integrated with Vault and SonarQube.
  **R**: Reduced pipeline creation time by 70% and increased adoption across 10+ development teams.

---

## ✅ **Fix Broken Pipelines (STAR Method)**

**S**: During a major Jenkins upgrade, 30+ pipelines started failing due to plugin incompatibilities.
**T**: Restore CI/CD reliability for active deployments.
**A**:

* Rolled back breaking plugin versions
* Audited and refactored shared library usage
* Coordinated with developers to test builds
  **R**: Fixed all critical pipelines in <48 hours and implemented version-locking for future stability.
