# Running Notes
- Object storage store any type of data[audio,video,tarfiles,pdf,logs]
- S3 is a Global Service but buckets are regional
- Majorly we are use s3 of storing log data from different services like[vpc-flow-logs,waf-logs,alb-access-logs,alb-connection-logs,cloud-trail-logs]
- We have buckets to store data called as objects buckets names should be unique because each and every can have URL
- Maximum Object size is 5TB

------------------
1. S3 Standard
2. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
3. S3 Standard-IA
4. S3 OneZone-IA
5. S3 Galcier

Durability = Ensure High Durability for Object for every 10000 object one object is loss for 10000 years
Availability = Ensure HA object can accessible any time

IAM Policies = Identity Baed Policies
Bucket Policies = Resource Based Policies
