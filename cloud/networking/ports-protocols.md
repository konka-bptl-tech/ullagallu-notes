### **Ports & Protocols**
---
### âœ… **What is a Port?**
* A **port** is a **16-bit number** (range: `0â€“65535`) used to identify specific processes or services on a system.
* It works at the **Transport Layer** (Layer 4) of the OSI model.
* Ports help the operating system determine **which application** should handle incoming/outgoing data.

### âœ… **What is a Protocol?**
* A **protocol** defines the set of rules for **formatting, transmitting, and receiving** data between devices.
* Protocols operate at different layers of the OSI or TCP/IP model (e.g., Transport, Application).
