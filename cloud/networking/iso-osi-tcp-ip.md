### **ISO/OSI Model**
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model explains how data travels from one device to another over a network.
It has **7 layers**, each with a specific job.

### ðŸ“š OSI 7 Layers (Top to Bottom)
| Layer | Name             | What it Does (In Simple Terms)                           |
| ----- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7     | **Application**  | User interacts here (e.g., browsers, email clients)      |
| 6     | **Presentation** | Converts data to readable format (encryption, encoding)  |
| 5     | **Session**      | Starts, manages, and ends sessions (like login sessions) |
| 4     | **Transport**    | Breaks data into chunks, ensures delivery (TCP/UDP)      |
| 3     | **Network**      | Chooses path, adds IP addresses (Routers work here)      |
| 2     | **Data Link**    | Adds MAC address, handles errors (Switches work here)    |
| 1     | **Physical**     | Actual cables, signals, and hardware transmission        |

### ðŸš€ Real-Life Example (Sending a WhatsApp Message)
1. **App Layer (7)** â€“ You type and send a message
2. **Transport Layer (4)** â€“ Message is broken into smaller packets
3. **Network Layer (3)** â€“ Each packet gets an IP address to reach the receiver
4. **Data Link + Physical (2 & 1)** â€“ Packets move through switches, cables, Wi-Fi
5. Reverse happens on receiverâ€™s side to rebuild the message

### ðŸ”„ Mnemonic to Remember:
> **All People Seem To Need Data Processing**
> (Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical)

### **TCP/IP Model**
The **TCP/IP model** is the actual model used on the internet.
It has **4 layers**, and it's more practical than OSI.

### ðŸ§± TCP/IP 4 Layers (Top to Bottom)
| Layer                 | What it Does (In Simple Terms)                            | Example Protocols     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **4. Application**    | Apps like browsers, emails, FTP, DNS, etc. interact here  | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS |
| **3. Transport**      | Breaks data into segments, handles reliable delivery      | TCP, UDP              |
| **2. Internet**       | Adds IP addresses, decides best route to destination      | IP, ICMP              |
| **1. Network Access** | Moves data physically (via cables, switches, Wi-Fi, etc.) | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ARP  |

### ðŸ”„ OSI vs TCP/IP Layer Mapping
| OSI Layer        | TCP/IP Layer        |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Application (7)  | Application (4)     |
| Presentation (6) | â†‘ Combined in       |
| Session (5)      | â†‘ Application Layer |
| Transport (4)    | Transport (3)       |
| Network (3)      | Internet (2)        |
| Data Link (2)    | Network Access (1)  |
| Physical (1)     | Network Access (1)  |

### ðŸ’¡ Key Points
* **TCP/IP is simpler (4 layers)**
* Itâ€™s used in **real-world networking** (like the internet)
* OSI is more of a **theoretical model**
