# 🧑‍💼 Day 7 – Reporting AWS Cost Optimization to Manager

## 🎯 Scenario  
You analyzed your AWS account and found opportunities to reduce cost — such as removing unused resources or right-sizing EC2 instances. You’re reporting this to your manager.

## 🗣️ Sample Message

Hi, I completed a quick audit of our AWS resources and found some optimization opportunities.  
We had a few unused EBS volumes and unattached Elastic IPs, which I’ve cleaned up.  
Also, I’ve suggested downsizing two EC2 instances where CPU usage was consistently under 10%.  
This should save around 20% on our monthly billing.  
Let me know if you’d like a detailed breakdown or want to review any recommendations.
