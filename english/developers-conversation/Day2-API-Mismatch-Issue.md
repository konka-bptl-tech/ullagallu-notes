# 👨‍💻 Day 2 – Discussing API Mismatch Issue with Developer

## 🎯 Scenario
The frontend is failing because it’s calling an API endpoint that was removed/renamed. You need to coordinate with the developer to fix it.

---

## 🗣️ Sample Message

Hey, I noticed the frontend is returning a 404 error when calling the `/user/profile` endpoint.  
It looks like the API was renamed in the backend but the frontend wasn’t updated.  
Can you confirm the latest endpoint path? I’ll coordinate with the frontend team to update it.

## ✅ 5 Useful Phrases

- The frontend is failing with a 404 error.
- Looks like there’s an API mismatch between frontend and backend.
- Can you confirm if the endpoint path has changed?
- I’ll notify the frontend team once you confirm the correct path.
- Let’s sync the API contract to avoid future breakage.
