# 👨‍💻 Day 4 – Coordinating on Log Format and Observability with Developer

## 🎯 Scenario
You're building a centralized logging setup. You need the developer to follow a consistent log format (e.g., JSON with certain fields) for better observability.

## 🗣️ Sample Message

Hey, I’m setting up centralized logging for better observability using CloudWatch and Elasticsearch.  
Can we align on a common log format — maybe structured JSON with timestamp, service name, and request ID?  
That will make it easier to filter and trace issues across services.  
Let me know if you want a sample format or I can update the logger config.
